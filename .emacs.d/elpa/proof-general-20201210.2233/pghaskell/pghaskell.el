;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This instance of PG is handy just for using script management to
;; cut-and-paste into a buffer running Haskell (ghci)
;;
;; I'm providing this so that tool demonstrators may use it instead of
;; tediously doing cut-and-paste of commands from a file.  No history
;; management, and nothing to do with theorem proving really!
;;
;; To use this instance of PG, visit a file with the ".pghci" extension
;; or type
;;
;;  M-x pghaskell-mode
;;
;; in an ordinary .h file.  (Check that you have enabled the instance
;; in proof-site.el).
